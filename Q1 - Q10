Q1: Write a program to input two numbers and display their sum.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
3 4
Output 1:
Sum = 7

Input 2:
-1 20
Output 2:
Sum = 19

*/

CODE -
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = -1,b = 20,sum;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    sum = a + b;

    printf("Sum = %d\n", sum);

    return 0;
}

Q2: Write a program to input two numbers and display their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
10 2
Output 1:
Sum=12, Diff=8, Product=20, Quotient=5

Input 2:
7 3
Output 2:
Sum=10, Diff=4, Product=21, Quotient=2

*/

CODE - 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 2;
    int sum, diff, product, quotient;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

  
    sum = a + b;
    diff = a - b;
    product = a * b;
    quotient = a / b;  
    
    printf("Sum=%d, Diff=%d, Product=%d, Quotient=%d\n", sum, diff, product, quotient);

    return 0;
}

Q3: Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its length and breadth.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
5 10
Output 1:
Area=50, Perimeter=30

Input 2:
3 7
Output 2:
Area=21, Perimeter=20

*/
